    Write a program that asks a user to guess your favorite move.
    If they guess correctly, print "You guessed it!"
    else, print "That is wrong"
    Note: Guesses should not be case sensitive.

    eg.:
        Guess my favorite movie: Conjuring
        That is wrong
        Guess my favorite movie: Avatar
        That is wrong
        Guess my favorite movie: The Stranger
        You guessed it!
